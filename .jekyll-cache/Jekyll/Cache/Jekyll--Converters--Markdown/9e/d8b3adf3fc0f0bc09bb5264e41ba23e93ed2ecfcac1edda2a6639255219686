<p>Given that the product was going to move straight from hi-fi designs to development, prior to producing each screen ‚Äì I had to ensure that I identified the theme of the product alongside components.</p>

<p>Given the branding guidelines from our client, I was able to work with those requirements and produce components from there. Each component had a passive, hover, active, focus and disabled state. With these component designs, it enforced me to then produced screens and use these components, allowing me to be consistent with each screen and avoiding a change of mind in designs (which would have caused multiple refinement tickets in the future for development).</p>

<p>Once these components were identified, I produced high fidelity screens from each wireframe. The hi-fi prototype were consistently re-iterated with user requirements and also what the client required from the product. User testing were conducted on the main screens, and those screens were adjusted according to user feedback.</p>

<p>At the same time, I was working in parallel as a business analyst and broke these screens down into user stories and tickets for development.</p>
