I"Q
<p>Given that Self Taught was already built and deployed, my client came to me to re-iterate the application and look into a modern user interface design as he wanted to reach more users.</p>

<p>Further understanding his problem, I did a few investigations on his project and noted down improvements that could be introduced.</p>

<p>I conducted user research with students who study languages and wanted to further advance their skills in their own accord. Additionally, I did market research and discovered what competitors where doing.</p>

<p>I presented my findings to my client and refined the problem to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>More modern user interface</li>
  <li>Simpler navigation system</li>
  <li>Quickly jump to a time gap and view changes</li>
  <li>Mobile responsive application</li>
  <li>Mobile user experience</li>
</ul>
