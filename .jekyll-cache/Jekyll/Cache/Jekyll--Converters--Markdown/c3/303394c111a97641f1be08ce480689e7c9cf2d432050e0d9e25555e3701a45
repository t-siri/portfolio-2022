<p>Each extensions were ideated independently given the course of how long they took. It was important to start surveying for ideas for each extension to ensure that the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) will be beneficial to Codebots once the platform goes live. Since there were multiple use cases and audiences for Codebots and these extensions, a significant amount of time was spent in regards to the ideation stage. It was also important to understand the user flow of each audience type in order to include the right features and functionalities and cater to the users. Multiple ideas were retrieved from multiple users during workshops and then voted on which ideas would be the quickest to accomplish and also align with the MVP of the product. After a few workshops during the ideation stage, we gathered a significant amount of useful information and started to refine these ideas. Each extension had requirements that were separated into three stages: Must have, Should have and Could have. This allowed us to refine the MVP with Must haves and depending on time, we could then include the Should haves.</p>
