<p>It was crucial to identify the key user journey during the sketching sessions as we wanted to ensure that part was done correctly before looking at branding and high fidelity screens. There were a few platforms (competitors) in the industry but from the discovery interview - they were too complex.</p>

<p>I made the assumption (from my gathered research) that customers are most likely to make bookings from word of mouth or reviews, and that we had to star the beauticians on the application. In addition, once a customer has found a beautician that have outstanding ratings, they wouldn’t mind paying extra for a custom service or a service that could fit their time slot. It was more about convenience and quality of service rather than availability and price. So I ensured that the sketches allowed custom booking requests.</p>

<p>In regards to the beauticians, their concern was mainly safety and the ability to choose who they want to provide their services to. Given that they are operating their services mostly at home, they wanted a sense of security in who they meet up and also a sense of security in getting paid. I was able to conclude that for them, they didn’t want to deal with users that cancel last minute or avoid paying. The result to that was to ensure that the application processed payments prior to making a booking and that beauticians had the power to accept or reject a booking before it is confirmed. Additionally, we also allowed beauticians to create custom bookings for customers to allow them to accommodate to their clients - as each client and each service is different.</p>

<p>Once the sketches and screens were refined, I was able to convert them into low fidelity wireframes (greyscale) and conducted user testing on these wireframes.</p>

<p>From the user testing on the wireframes, it was concluded that our user flow was heading towards the right direction but there were some sections that could have been improved and some requested features for both customers and beauticians. I refined the wireframes according to the feedback received and conducted user testing again until the outcome and feedback was positive.</p>
