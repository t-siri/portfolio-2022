<p>I identified that the prototype required a more modernised but simple approach to the user interface design. Given that there are two main navigating systems and nested information, the simplicity of the UI is crucial. I started the mobile designs first and re-iterated with my client with the navigating system and the nested pages. From there I conducted user testing and made updates in regards to component placements and sizes. Once user testing resulted into a manner where our users were able to complete assigned tasks on the prototype without hesitation, I immediately moved onto the web application prototype. Given the web application provides more real estate in regards to UI placement, it was less complex as the mobile prototype. I user tested the web application and re-iterated a few components and presented to my client.</p>
