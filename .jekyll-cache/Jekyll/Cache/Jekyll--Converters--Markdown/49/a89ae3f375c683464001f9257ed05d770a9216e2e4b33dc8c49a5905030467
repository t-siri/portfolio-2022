<p>STAKT is a cyrpto trading application based in Australia with a goal to cater towards users with little to no knowledge in the industry but wants to invest in cryptocurrency. During my employment with PatientZero, I had the opportunity to work on this project as a Product Owner and a Product Designer. Given it was a GreenField project, there were multiple workshops that were required to accomplish the desired outcome of the product.</p>

<p>In addition to designing the product, I had to balance between the importance of design and producing a minimum viable product. As this project immediately moved from design straight to development where I was the Product Owner, it was very important to ensure that consistency of designs occur at the start of the project.</p>
