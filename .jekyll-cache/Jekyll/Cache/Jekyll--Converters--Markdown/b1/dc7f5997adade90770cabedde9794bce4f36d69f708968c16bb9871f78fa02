<p>Given time was very limited, sketches were immediately converted to wireframes. I also took the time to see what other competitors were doing and from the discovery interviews I conducted previously, I identified key features that could enhance the product.</p>

<p>Simplicity and education was the most important requirements that STAKT wanted from the product, each screen had a goal to the next and it guided users unconciously step by step following the user flow.</p>
