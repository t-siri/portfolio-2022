<p>Upon narrowing down the problem, I started interviewing the designers and developers on what they wanted to see in this <em>source of truth</em>. I gathered what was important to designers in regards to consistency in components and what was important to developers in regards to consistency in states.</p>

<p>Since Codebots have both light and dark theme, it was clear that components can become overwhelming and confusing, therefore documenting components for both categories was crucial.</p>

<p>After gathering ideas from both parties, I was able to conclude what Solaris (source of truth) should contain:</p>

<p class="b ul-heading">Designers</p>
<ul>
  <li>Components
    <ul>
      <li>Sizes</li>
      <li>Padding</li>
      <li>Fonts</li>
      <li>Colours</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rules
    <ul>
      <li>When and where to use components</li>
      <li>How to use components</li>
      <li>Purpose of different components</li>
      <li>Theme rules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Designers documentation
    <ul>
      <li>When to use the component in designs</li>
      <li>Purpose of the component</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="b ul-heading">Developers</p>
<ul>
  <li>Component
    <ul>
      <li>What is available</li>
      <li>States</li>
      <li>Name of components</li>
      <li>Values of components (padding pixels, height, fonts)</li>
      <li>Types (outline buttons, solid buttons, text buttons, icon buttons)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ability to view component variations according to themes</li>
  <li>Developers documentation
    <ul>
      <li>Ability to understand how to re-use and call components</li>
      <li>How the code is written</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
