<p>The challenge of this project was to identify the user flow of both Campaigners and Promoters. We wanted to make sure that the product allows simplistic usability but also provides all the capabilities required for both user groups.</p>

<p>It was important that users could identify the goal of the application and immediately proceed accordingly according to their persona.</p>

<p>As YouTrumpet was heavily driven on campaigns, it was important for campaigners to create and manage their campaigns on the application. Alongside, promoters had to track how the campaigns they are promoting is going.</p>

<p>Throughout the re-iterations of understanding the user flow and goals of the two users, we started to recognise the key features and user journey of the application. From there, we were able to work on sketches and wireframes in order to refine the application flow.</p>

<p>Alongside these sketches, our client required a new branding palette which was consistently re-iterated. It was crucial that the product contained a serious but also exciting demeanour.</p>
