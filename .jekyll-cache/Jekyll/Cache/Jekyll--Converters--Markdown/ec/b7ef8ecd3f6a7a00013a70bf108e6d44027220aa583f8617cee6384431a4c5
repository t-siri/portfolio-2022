<p>After a successful scope with Kindredâ€™s client portal, our client wanted us to further expand on the platform and look into a more feasible way for Admin usersâ€™ workflow to be a part of the platform in order to have a better process in their routine of work.</p>

<p>Given the broadness of the problem, it was important to conduct user interviews. Once gathering feedback from Managers (Admin users), we were able to refine the problem and focus on the core pain point the Mangers were currently undergoing in regards to their workflow.</p>

<p>We presented the findings to Kindredâ€™s CEO and identified that Mangers are not able to keep track on how the companyâ€™s daily progress in regards to customer service, sales, and client satisfaction. In addition, it uncertain on how successful the Green Zone Portal was and if the portal was reaching to any customers or having a positive impact. Therefore, it was crucial for Managers to track the companyâ€™s progress in general, and in addition, with the right statistics, marketers would be able to provide the right campaigns to the right customers according to their level of interaction on the platform.</p>
