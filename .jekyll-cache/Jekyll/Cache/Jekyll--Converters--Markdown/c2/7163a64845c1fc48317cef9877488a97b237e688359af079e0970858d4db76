<p>Given the freedom of this being my idea, I produced a palette and design system that I liked. The narrative and the colours of the application was designed to be more fun and bold. Given that it is already painful to be allergic to things and having to read through the ingredients list every time you pick up a new product - I wanted to ensure that the application use felt less like a chore or a forced feeling but more of a ‘curious about a product’ feeling.</p>

<p>It was crucial to keep the application very simple, we want users to jump onto the application, add their allergies and scan or search for products that they could be allergic to or are trying to avoid.</p>

<p>I also wanted the application to be an everyday use product, so that users didn’t always have to re-scan things when they’re out shopping. Users could customise to Steer Clear of multiple things, whether it’s ingredients they’re allergic to or just trying to avoid consciously. Each time the user scans a product that results into steering clear of it or being a conscious buyer, the product is saved against their profile.</p>
