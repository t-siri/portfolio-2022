<p>The problem that was defined within the workflow of Codebots was how designers and developers could not find the source of truth in regards to the companyâ€™s branding, resulting to inconsistency in design and development. It was clear that a source of truth needed to be produce in order to harmonise the workflow.</p>

<p>To further understand the actual pain points and the struggles of the workflow, I conducted user interviews internally with designers and developers. It was discovered that it was uncertain on how components should look and be designed, therefore leading front-end development to become inconsistent as well given that development derives from prototypes.</p>
