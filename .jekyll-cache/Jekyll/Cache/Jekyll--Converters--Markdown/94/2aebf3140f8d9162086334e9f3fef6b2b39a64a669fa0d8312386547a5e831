<p>Given the amount of time put into researching and finding inspiration. I was able to come up with a design that not only represented the business but also encouraged buyers to understand how special and personalised each product is.</p>

<p>I felt that Ross’ work is astonishing and that it should do most of the <em>talking</em> on the website, so I made his work the star of the show and also the wood that he provided a personalised <em>voice</em> and <em>tone</em></p>

<p>Each product has a background introduction to what it is, and also what type of wood it uses. From there, users were able to click on each wood to further read the wood’s history, usage and Ross’ opinions on it.</p>

<p>I also made sure that the website was not only a gallery of astonishing work but also a gateway to purchasing products, so it was important that flow was seamless, hence the navigation system and the ability to scroll aimlessly on the home page to look for inspiration.</p>

<p>Customisation builds were also very important as it is the unique selling point that our client provides. I wanted the user to feel like they are building a product with character; personalised to their home with a touch of their artistic values. It was crucial that the ability of personalisation was in every walk through of the steps upon building a custom product.</p>
