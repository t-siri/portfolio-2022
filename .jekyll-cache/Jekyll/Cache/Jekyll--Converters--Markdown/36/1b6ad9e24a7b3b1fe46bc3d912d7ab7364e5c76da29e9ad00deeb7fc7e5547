<p>Since most of the time was spent on wireframes and re-iterating the user flow, producing the high-fidelity screens was no issue.</p>

<p>I was able to spend some time to look for inspiration in regards to branding and colours - and from there I started to conduct a palette for the application.</p>

<p>Using the wireframe screens, I converted them into high-fidelity screens with the palette that I have designed and it started to come all together.</p>

<p>Finally, I conducted user testing on the high fidelity prototype on 4 potential customers and 4 potential beauticians. The result of the user testing only required minor adjustments. Once I re-iterated and refined those designs, I did a final run of user testing and was able to complete the scope and product design.</p>
