<p>Upon narrowing down the problem, we started workshopping on potential ideas with the client on what the Admin users might require in order to simplify their workflow in the company. We brainstormed multiple ideas with post-it notes and grouped them together.</p>

<p>After ideating with our clients, we refined the ideas with Admin users and the CEO during the ideation workshop by asking them to vote on which grouping of post-it notes felt the most important to them.</p>

<p>This resulted into the following:</p>
