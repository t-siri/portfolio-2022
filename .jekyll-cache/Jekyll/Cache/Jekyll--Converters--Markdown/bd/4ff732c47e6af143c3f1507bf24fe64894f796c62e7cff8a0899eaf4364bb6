<p>Given time was very limited, sketches were immediately converted to wireframes. From the user journey flow, I was able to identify the key screens to ensure that the product could complete the key tasks for an MVP. I also took the time to see what other competitors were doing and from the discovery interviews I conducted previously, I identified key features that could enhance the product.</p>

<p>Simplicity and education was the most important requirements that STAKT wanted from the product, each screen had a goal to the next and it guided users unconciously step by step following the user flow.</p>

<p>Conducting user testing with these wireframes, I wanted to ensure that each user was eventually proceeding to each step that was identified on the user journey flow and also reaching the end goal. Designs of the grey-scale wireframes were consistently re-iterated until we were ready to move onto the high-fidelity designs.</p>
