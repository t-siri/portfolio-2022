<p>The importance of this product was to identify the core problem in the market and also find patterns of what users in the industry have to say.</p>

<p>I took the time to interview 4 potential customers and 4 potential beauticians prior to establishing a user flow. During these interviews it was clear that there wasnâ€™t a platform that provided a simple booking system for sole trading beauticians.</p>

<p>Customers had to find their preferred beauticians within their area using social media, whilst Beauticians had to post their services on social media and kept track of their calendar and bookings on a seperate platform.</p>

<p>After identifying the key pain points and patterns from these interviews, I was able to conclude what the ideal application would be for these user types. The main flow and features for the customers concluded to the ability to search for services nearby, book these services or message the Beautician privately for a custom services. Whereas for the beauticians, they want to easily post different types services, manage conflicting bookings and custom services.</p>

<p>From there I created sketches for the customerâ€™s flow and the beauticianâ€™s flow.</p>
