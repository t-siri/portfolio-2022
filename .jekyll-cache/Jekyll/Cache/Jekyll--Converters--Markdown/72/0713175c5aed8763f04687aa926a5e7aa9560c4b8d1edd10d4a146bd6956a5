I developed an online design system for employees to refer to the company’s branding and design rules.</p>

<p>I designed the <a href="/codebotssolaris">Codebots Solaris Design System</a>, developed it and alongside worked on the components with my lead, Isaac Joekong and my coworker Raouf Al-Araji.</p>
