<p>During my employment with <a href="https://workingmouse.com.au/" target="_blank">WorkingMouse</a>, I had the opportunity as a UIX designer, front-end developer and standards documenter to work with <a href="www.codebots.com" target="_blank">Codebots</a> and design a bot styling library alongside bot components.</p>

<p>Harmony is a library with standardised and documented HTML and SCSS that is shared across both bots in Codebots. What these bots provide from Codebots is a quick kickstart to an application, providing simple components alongside complex components (extensions).</p>

<p>The designs of these components have been consistently re-iterated alongside the code through out the years upon creation.</p>
