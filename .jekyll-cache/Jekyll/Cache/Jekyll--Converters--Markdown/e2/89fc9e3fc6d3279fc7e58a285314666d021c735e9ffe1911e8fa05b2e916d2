<p>With the flexibility of this product and the requirements are from what I wanted from it, I was able to create the final high-fidelity prototype to my own liking.</p>

<p>I validated my designs with a few friends that I know suffer from allergies and those that are trying to be more sustainable with their everyday purchases. I received positive feedback and some feedback in regards to additional features and changes in features.</p>

<p>I now have the refined high-fidelity prototype and am hoping to have this application being developed soon.</p>
