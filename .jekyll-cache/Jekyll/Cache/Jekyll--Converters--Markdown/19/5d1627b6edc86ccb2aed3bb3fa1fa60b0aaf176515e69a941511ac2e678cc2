<p>Carted is a side project I have founded and is a current work in progress in regards to development.</p>

<p>One day, I walked into IKEA and wanted a chair but did not want to pay the full price, and thought to myself: <em>If only I could scan the barcode of the item and get a notification when the product has reduced in price.</em></p>

<p>I felt that there was a gap in shopping and how it could be further simplified in regards to finding the right products at a great price.</p>
