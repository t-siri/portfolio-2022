<p>Ross Alan owns a well established wood working company in Los Angeles and he wanted to work on re-branding his company.</p>

<p>I had the honour to work with a development team as a designer during this process and produced a marketing and commercial website for him.</p>

<p>The project was mainly focusing on honouring Rossâ€™ products and to showcase his work and also the companyâ€™s representation, which is personalisation.</p>
