<p>Given that the product was going to move straight from hi-fi designs to development, prior to producing each screen â€“ I had to ensure that I identified the theme of the product alongside components.</p>

<p>The clients provided their branding guidelines which allowed me to produce the key product theme and components. Each component had a passive, hover, active, focus and disabled state. With this, it enforced me to then produce screens and use these components, allowing consistency with each screen and avoiding a change of mind in designs (which would have caused multiple refinement tickets in the future for development).</p>

<p>Once these components were identified, I produced high fidelity screens from each wireframe. User testing were conducted on the main screens and given that the wireframes were mainly re-iterated, there were only minor tweaks required for the hi-fi designs.</p>

<p>At the same time, I was working in parallel as a business analyst and broke these screens down into user stories and tickets for development. I also had to order the backlog according to dependencies and pre-requisites of each feature.</p>
