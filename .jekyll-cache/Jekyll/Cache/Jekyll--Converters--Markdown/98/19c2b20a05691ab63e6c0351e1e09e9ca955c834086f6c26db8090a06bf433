<p>With the problem statement I started ideating multiple solutions of what this platform could be. I did some research to see what competitors were doing and realised that the competitors were a decade behind in design and usability. I tested out the competitorsâ€™ applications and realised that it was a very average user experience in general.</p>

<p>I started sketching screens and writing down a few feature ideas of Carted and started conducting user testing with online shoppers. I discovered their pain points were very similar to mine and that I could simplify online shopping with Carted.</p>

<p>It was important that Carted saved users time in regards to researching for the product online, but also while they are physically online shopping. Users also wanted to be notified when an item they are watching has dropped in price.</p>
