<p>Steer Clear is an application that I have designed and scoped on my own. It’s a passion project of mine that I want to share with multiple people struggling with the transparency of ingredients being used in products.</p>

<p>I personally want to use this application myself to simplify my everyday life. I have some allergies to ingredients that I must avoid and alongside that I want to avoid a few others that are not sustainably sourced.</p>

<p>After undergoing an allergy test, I realised that each ingredient had multiple different names associated to it and I wasn’t able to memorise every single ingredient that I had to avoid.</p>

<p>From there - I thought it would be ideal to have an application that could simplify my everyday shopping experience by just scanning products and letting me know if I could purchase it or not.</p>
