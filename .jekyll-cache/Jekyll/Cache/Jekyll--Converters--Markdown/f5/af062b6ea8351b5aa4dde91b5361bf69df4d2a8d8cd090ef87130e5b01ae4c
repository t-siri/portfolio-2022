<p>With the refined ideas, I spent some time researching competitors and what others were doing. As a lot of realestate companies did not really have products that were related to customer service, I also conducted market research in regards to online customer service. I researched for inspiration and put my findings together in order to start sketching a few outcomes of how the platform could resulted to. This process was continuous where I would sketch potential screens and journeys and conducted user testing for feedback. With the feedback I would re-sketch the outcomes, re-iterate them and conducted user testing again. Once the user testing feedback were positive, where the users wanted to use the platform and engage with it, I then did wireframe mockups.</p>

<p>I then user tested the wireframes and re-iterated on them. I then presented the wireframes to Kindred, presented the user journey and what the user will experience. After a few feedback, I was happy with where the wireframes and the journey resulted into.</p>

<p>I gathered the screens from my wireframes and started to produce a high-fidelity prototype. Using XD, I produced the mobile screens for Kindredâ€™s users first and immediately user tested the mobile mock-up. I re-iterated on the prototype in regards to UI designs, on where the buttons could be sitting, size of buttons and placement of components. Once the final stage of user testing was completed, I proceeded to designing the web platform prototype and conducted user testing.</p>

<p>In order for the clients to communicate seamlessly with the customer service team, Kindred needed a customer service portal.</p>

<p>I conducted market research in online customer service alongside inspiration on similar platforms such as chatting and customer service platforms (identifying customers quickly in order to retain a strong relationship). I started sketching the customer service portal and immediately user tested them. Given that the feedback from the customer service team was immediately positive, I went straight to Hi-Fi prototyping. I user tested the Hi-Fi prototype and refined the prototype from the feedback given by the customer service team.</p>
