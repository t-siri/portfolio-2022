<p>Once understanding and refining Kindredâ€™s problem, we then started to brainstorm on what this platform could do. This involved going through an ideal user journey according to persona types and throwing out ideas on how to make the journey pleasant. We had a white boarding session on possible outcomes that would solve the problem we refined previously. There were multiple solutions that branched out from the ideation stage, and it was crucial to refine those ideation.</p>

<p>After the ideation workshop, I worked with the client in regards to refining these ideas and understanding on which ones we wanted to focus on.</p>

<p>This resulted into the following:</p>
