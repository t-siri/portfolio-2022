<p>Kindred came to us with a problem where he felt that the real-estate industry is not doing a satisfactory job in regards to promptly responding to customers. Our client came to us and wanted us to find a solution for not only their business but also the industry as a whole.</p>

<p>In order to understand and unpack the problem, I was able to run through discovery/user interviews with the users (Kindred’s clients) and the customer service team. After a few interviews with both audiences, we were able to refine the wicked problem.</p>

<p>Kindred’s users wanted to be able to continuously contact real-estate agents at times that are convenient with them. They wanted to be able to also have generic questions that are not related to properties answered, such as first home buying, property investments and the suburb they are interested in.</p>

<p>As for real-estate agents, they wanted to be able to communicate with their customers and solve their problem quickly but also understand their customer — a background on what their customer is looking for or goals are.</p>

<p>We presented the findings to our client and have recognised that the users wanted to be able to feel like Kindred was not just a company that provided properties but an experience to individuals that had uncertainty with the whole process. From there, Kindred discovered that it was ideal to have a platform that allowed their customers to interact with them and their customer service team seamlessly about anything related to purchasing a property — a relationship rather than a transaction.</p>
