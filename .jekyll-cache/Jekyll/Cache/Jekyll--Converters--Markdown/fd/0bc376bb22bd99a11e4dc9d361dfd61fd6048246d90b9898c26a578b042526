<p>During my employment with <a href="/workingmouse" target="_blank">WorkingMouse</a> I had the opportunity to work with <a href="/codebotsmarketing">Codebots</a> and developed both <a href="/work-codebots-v1">version 1</a> and version 2 of the marketing website.</p>

<p>After deploying the MVP of version 1, the company had the opportunity to do some user testing and user research to further improve the marketing site in order to get more tractions.</p>

<p>My lead, Isaac Joekong, conducted a user testing on version 1 of the marketing website and made design updates accordingly.</p>
