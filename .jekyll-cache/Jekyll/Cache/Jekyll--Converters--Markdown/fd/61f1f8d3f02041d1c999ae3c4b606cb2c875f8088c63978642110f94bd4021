<p>Our clients had a clear goal on what they want to build and with every vision, it was important to narrow it down and find the minimum viable product.</p>

<p>It was important to identify key users and personas for the project in order to then proceed with the main user flow of the application. After identifying with the client what the product goal is and who their key users were, it was found that there were two main users that sit at both sides of the spectrum â€“ one of which who had no confidence in cryptocurrency and the other knowing exactly what they are doing in the industry and consistently trading/investing.</p>

<p>I conducted a few discovery interviews of users that fit the following personas to identify the gap in the market and where STAKT could stand out uniquely. We were able to find key patterns and pain points from these interviews which allowed us to produce a simplified user journey flow.</p>

<p>A user journey flow was workshopped with the clients, we often have a starting point and an end goal point, from there we find the pre-requisites and goals to reach to each point. Once a simplified and desired user journey flow has been identified, I was able to come up with a few sketches.</p>
