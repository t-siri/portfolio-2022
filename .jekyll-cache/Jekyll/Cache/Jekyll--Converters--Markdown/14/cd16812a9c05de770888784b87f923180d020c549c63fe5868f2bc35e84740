<p>Belle Up is a beauty application project that I had the opportunity to scope and design with my clients. The goal of this product is to provide a platform for beauticians to create their services where-ever and whenever they choose to do so.</p>

<p>We wanted to star the beauticians in this application, as it was clear that without them, the application was non-existent.</p>

<p>The second goal was to ensure that the application was easily used between the two types of users (Customers and Beauticians) and that we could cater multiple types of users looking for beauty servicse on the platform without overwhelming them with too many features.</p>
