<p>The importance of this product was to identify the core problem in the market and also find patterns of what users in the industry have to say.</p>

<p>I took the time to interview 4 potential customers and 4 potential beauticians prior to establishing a user flow. During these interviews it was clear that there wasn’t a platform that provided a simple booking system for sole trading beauticians.</p>

<p>Customers had to find their preferred beauticians within their area using social media, whilst Beauticians had to post their services on social media and kept track of their calendar and bookings on a seperate platform.</p>

<p>After identifying the key pain points and patterns from these interviews, I was able to walk through a user journey flow for the two users.</p>

<p>From there I created sketches for the customer’s flow and the beautician’s flow.</p>
