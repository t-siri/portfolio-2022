<p>Once the wireframes were confirmed alongside the branding palette, I started to design the high-fidelity designs of the application.</p>

<p>This included some inspiration research on what competitors are doing: where they went well and where they could improve. It was identified that YouTrumpetâ€™s competitors did well in regards to providing campaign data, but the visual aspects of how the data was represented could have been improved.</p>

<p>From there, I started to mock-up more modern visuals and combined important data visualisation for both Campaigners and Promoters.</p>

<p>The main flow of the application is for Campaigners to create campaigns and for Promoters to promote them, therefore it was crucial for the flow to be easily navigated.</p>
