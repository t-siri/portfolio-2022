<p>Given the amount of time put into researching, re-iterating user flows and wireframes alongside understanding the user personas. I was able to produce an MVP application that accommodated the user goals.</p>

<p>I identified that data was important for Campaigners, and that at the same time, data can be overwhelming when it is not visualised in a flowing manner. I separated important everyday stats and reporting stats on separate pages to avoid content overload for Campaigners. I also minimised the amount of data for Promoters as they do not require every single information of a campaign, but instead the campaigns they promoted.</p>
