<p>With the sketches I produced from the ideation stage, I discovered that during the user testing that these sketches were valid and users had positive feedback in regards to the journey of the application and the simplicity of its features.</p>

<p>From there I started inspiration research in regards to branding and component layouts. I wanted the colours to be less of a <em>spending</em> money experience but a <em>list</em> of things you want to be notified about. It was also very important to immediately search for products or find products, hence the search being on the home page. Barcode scanning functionality is also important for users that like to physically window shop.</p>

<p>I immediately went to the Hi-Fi prototype and ran through user testing. I re-iterated the prototype with a few tweaks in regards to component placement but also additional features.</p>
