<p>The problem for me which I discovered was a common problem with other users as well was that it was very tedious to find items for the best price and the amount spent on finding the right product at a discounted price could be shorten by more than half. In addition, upon finding the right product at a discounted price would not always favour in what you are willing to pay for, so you end up leaving the tab opened and constantly refreshing the page to see if prices have changed.</p>

<p>From here I refined the general issue into a problem statement: <em>How can we have a better window shopping experience and purchase an item at the lowest price, or the price we are willing to pay with minimal research time spent</em></p>
