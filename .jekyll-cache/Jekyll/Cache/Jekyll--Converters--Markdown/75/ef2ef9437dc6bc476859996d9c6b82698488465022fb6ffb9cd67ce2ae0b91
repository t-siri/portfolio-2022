<p>It was crucial to identify the key user journey and flows during the sketching sessions as we wanted to ensure that part was done correctly before looking at branding and high fidelity screens.</p>

<p>Once the sketches and screens were refined, I was able to convert them into low fidelity wireframes (greyscale) and conducted user testing on these wireframes.</p>

<p>From the user testing on the wireframes, it was concluded that our user flow was heading towards the right direction but there were some sections that could have been improved and some requested features for both customers and beauticians. I refined the wireframes according to the feedback received and conducted user testing again until the outcome and feedback was positive.</p>
