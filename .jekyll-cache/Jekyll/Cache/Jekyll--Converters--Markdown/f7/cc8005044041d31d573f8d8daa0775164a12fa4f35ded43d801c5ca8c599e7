<p>Given that this product was an idea that stemmed from the pain points of my everyday life, I identified the problem on my own and then validated with other individuals I knew that suffered with allergies as well. I also asked a few people that were conscious with their lifestyle on how they avoided their chosen ingredients.</p>

<p>It was clear that everyone was spending a significant amount of time reading every ingredient of each product they were purchasing. If they were uncertain about the ingredient, they would not purchase the product at all.</p>

<p>I could identify that there was not a standardised way to clearly let people know what types of ingredients are being used in products, and for those who care about these ingredients have a harder time. I wanted to cater to them, but also I wanted to make my life easier as well.</p>

<p>I started brainstorming a few things for this application, from a chrome extension to an application. Once I concluded to what I wanted from this idea, I was able to produce a few sketches.</p>
