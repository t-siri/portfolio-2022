<p>Our client had a clear goal on what they want to build and with every vision, it was important to narrow it down.</p>

<p>Key users and personas were identified for the project in order to then proceed with the main user flow of the application. After identifying with the client what the product goal is and who their key users were, it was found that there were two main users that sit at both sides of the spectrum â€“ one of which who had no confidence in cryptocurrency and the other knowing exactly what they are doing in the industry and consistently trading/investing.</p>

<p>I conducted a few discovery interviews of users that fit the following personas to identify the gap in the market and where STAKT could stand out uniquely. We were able to find key patterns and pain points from these interviews which allowed us to produce a simplified user journey flow.</p>

<p>User journey flows for the two identified user types were workshopped with the clients, this included with a starting point and an end goal for each user, from there we identified pre-requisites and parallel journeys to reach to each point. Once the desired user journey flows were identified, I was able to come up with a few sketches.</p>

<p>Each page were sketched according to the user journey flows, we were able to find key screens for the product where users could potentially come across. At the same time I had to ensure that we were staying on task with an MVP.</p>
