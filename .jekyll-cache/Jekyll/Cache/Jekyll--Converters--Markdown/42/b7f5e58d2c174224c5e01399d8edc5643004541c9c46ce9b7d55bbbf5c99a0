<p>It was very important that the SCSS and HTML code written in Harmony was clear, concise and well documented. As the code will be shared across multiple developers and will have to be customisable, I conducted user research with developers (specifically front-end developers). I wanted to understand how they felt about SCSS and what their limitations were in regards to the language.</p>

<p>From there I was able to split up the code into sections: Abstracts, Elements, Components and Extensions. The order of these sections were imported specifically in order for developers to apply minimal custom code to customise the look of their application. I have set up the code in a way where it is simple to modify the look of the application by just focusing on two sections: Abstracts and Elements. Given how components and extensions are a group of elements, the custom code change would cascade down and automatically apply these changes.</p>

<p>The library comes in three different styles, Codebots light theme, dark theme and neutral theme. Depending on the users and how much they want to customise the look of their application, they had the ability to choose the theme they would like to work with. Harmony is also accessible in regards to DOM structure and colour accessibility. Functions and mixins were written and used to specifically ensure that all components were accessible. Given that the DOM structure is documented to standards, the library styles both new bots using the same code and any future bots as long as the front-end follows the documented standards.</p>
