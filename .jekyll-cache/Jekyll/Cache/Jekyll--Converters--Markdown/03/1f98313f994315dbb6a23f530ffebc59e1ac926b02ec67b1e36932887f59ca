<p>As we refined the colours and typography, we started to do some research. This included researching for inspiration and noting down what competitors were doing well and what they were not doing well. It was clear that most competitors let their products do the talking. So we noted down that it was important to have Rossâ€™ work be the star of the show, and additionally added his personalisation to each product as it was clear that his work and passion lies within the woods that he worked with.</p>

<p>From there, we were able to create a unique experience of the website. Each product had their own wood <em>tone</em> and usage. We made sure that each product had a background story to it.</p>

<p>In addition, we made sure there was library of wood that our client uses in his projects and what he believed which woods were best used for and the tone each wood set. We wanted to build character for each wood piece and gave a touch of Rossâ€™ passionate review of the products.</p>

<p>The content was constantly refined as it was important that the voice of our client came through each section of the website but also that the website lead to purchase.</p>

<p>Given that Ross also provides custom builds, we wanted to build a process of customisation seamless and personalised. We were able to refine this process in a step by step flow and at the end to make sure that the client has felt safe with their purchase.</p>
