<p>From refining what is required of the extension to produce the MVP, me and my colleagues started sketching out ideas on potential screens and the flow of the screens. These sketches were constantly re-iterated after user testing them with potential users. Once the sketches have reached to a point where our users understood the purpose and the use of the extension, we started wireframing the sketches and connecting the screens together. User testing was immediately conducted and these wireframes were updated, specifically in regards to the extensionâ€™s components and functionality of the components. From wireframes being refined, we moved onto the Hi-Fi prototype. The prototype was tested on all audiences, given the complexity of some of these extensions, we wanted to make sure that the designs of the extensions were simple and clear to use. We would tell our user what their goal is upon testing the prototype and observe how they navigate throughout the screens. Gathering information from that, the prototype was re-iterated until our user was able to conveniently accomplish the goal we set out for them during user testing. From there I started documenting the components and extensions, alongside the SCSS library that will style these components to a standardised manner.</p>
