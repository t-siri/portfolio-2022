<p>Given the refined ideas after the ideation stage, it was somewhat clear on what the user flows were for Admin users and Marketers. I researched for inspiration, common patterns, and what competitors were doing in regards to displaying statistics without overwhelming the user and patterns of campaign creating platforms. With the outcome of my research, I started sketching a few screens and continuously re-iterated them by user testing my sketches and refining the user flow and the components. Continuously iterating, a point was reached where the users were satisfied with the flow of the screen of the sketches, I then started to wireframe the sketches and did a final round of user testing. I made a few minor tweaks to the wireframes regarding on components and placements of them and started on the Hi-Fi prototype.</p>

<p>Given that the Green Zone Portal was already scoped, I was able to expand on the original prototype and design the extended screens for the Admin users. The clickable prototype was then user tested continuously alongside re-iterating the designs.</p>

<p>As the main user for the Admin portal was Kindredâ€™s CEO, we presented the prototype and made a few minor tweaks and went straight to development.</p>
