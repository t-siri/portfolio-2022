<p>From the refinement of the problem that my client had, it was crucial to identify the userâ€™s journey in order to produce the right navigating system. The client and I workshopped on a few user journeys and were able to identify the main user journey for the students using the application. From there, I spent some time researching for inspiration and patterns in regards to platforms that were doing similar functionalities. I presented my findings to my client and we started to brainstorm a few ideas on what the mobile application could additionally have the web application did not. My client and I discussed on potential features that could be included in the new designs. From there, I spent some time sketching a few ideas of the mobile application as well as a few tweaks I the web application, showed my client and re-iterated on the sketches. Once he had a clear understanding of the sketches, I started inspiration research in regards to user interface designs and noted down on design changes that could be made. From there, I immediately moved onto the Hi-Fi prototype.</p>
