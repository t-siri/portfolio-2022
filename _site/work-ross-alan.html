        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Ross Alan owns a well established wood working company in Los Angeles and he wanted to work on re-branding his company.</p>

<p>I had the honour to work with a development team as a designer during this process and produced a marketing and commercial website for him.</p>

<p>The project was mainly focusing on honouring Ross’ products and to showcase his work and also the company’s representation, which is personalisation.</p>

        <p class="h3">Understand & refine</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>The challenge of this project was to identify Ross’ brand and his voice. It was clear that the client wanted the website to represent his work in a timeless and modern design.</p>

<p>It was crucial that the visualisation represented bright, timeless and also make sure that the star of the show were the woods that Ross’ provided.</p>

<p>Our client was highly passionate in the industry and the biggest challenge was to illustrate his passion throughout the website.</p>

<p>Throughout the re-iterations of understanding the voice of Ross Alan, we started to recognise the key tones of the brand and from there we started to work on the visual representations of what Ross’ business represented.</p>

<p>Colour palettes and typography was first identified, and from there we were able to start coming up with multiple solutions of the marketing site.</p>

        <p class="h3">Ideate & refine</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>As we refined the colours and typography, we started to do some research. This included researching for inspiration and noting down what competitors were doing well and what they were not doing well. It was clear that most competitors let their products do the talking. So we noted down that it was important to have Ross’ work be the star of the show, and additionally added his personalisation to each product as it was clear that his work and passion lies within the woods that he worked with.</p>

<p>From there, we were able to create a unique experience of the website. Each product had their own wood <em>tone</em> and usage. We made sure that each product had a background story to it.</p>

<p>In addition, we made sure there was library of wood that our client uses in his projects and what he believed which woods were best used for and the tone each wood set. We wanted to build character for each wood piece and gave a touch of Ross’ passionate review of the products.</p>

<p>The content was constantly refined as it was important that the voice of our client came through each section of the website but also that the website lead to purchase.</p>

<p>Given that Ross also provides custom builds, we wanted to build a process of customisation seamless and personalised. We were able to refine this process in a step by step flow and at the end to make sure that the client has felt safe with their purchase.</p>

        <p class="h3">Build, test & re-iterate</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Given the amount of time put into researching and finding inspiration. I was able to come up with a design that not only represented the business but also encouraged buyers to understand how special and personalised each product is.</p>

<p>I felt that Ross’ work is astonishing and that it should do most of the <em>talking</em> on the website, so I made his work the star of the show and also the wood that he provided a personalised <em>voice</em> and <em>tone</em></p>

<p>Each product has a background introduction to what it is, and also what type of wood it uses. From there, users were able to click on each wood to further read the wood’s history, usage and Ross’ opinions on it.</p>

<p>I also made sure that the website was not only a gallery of astonishing work but also a gateway to purchasing products, so it was important that flow was seamless, hence the navigation system and the ability to scroll aimlessly on the home page to look for inspiration.</p>

<p>Customisation builds were also very important as it is the unique selling point that our client provides. I wanted the user to feel like they are building a product with character; personalised to their home with a touch of their artistic values. It was crucial that the ability of personalisation was in every walk through of the steps upon building a custom product.</p>
