        <p class="h3">Introduction</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>YouTrumpet is a company in America that focuses heavily on community driven campaigns. The goal of the business is to self promote campaigns that individuals are passionate about.</p>

<p>I had the honour to work with a development team as a designer during this process and designed an application for two user personas: Campaigners and Promoters.</p>

<p>The project was mainly focusing on allowing campaigners to create a campaign and for promoters to promote those campaigns that they are passionate about.</p>

        <p class="h3">Understand & refine</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>The challenge of this project was to identify the user flow of both Campaigners and Promoters. We wanted to make sure that the product allows simplistic usability but also provides all the capabilities required for both user groups.</p>

<p>It was important that users could identify the goal of the application and immediately proceed accordingly according to their persona.</p>

<p>As YouTrumpet was heavily driven on campaigns, it was important for campaigners to create and manage their campaigns on the application. Alongside, promoters had to track how the campaigns they are promoting is going.</p>

<p>Throughout the re-iterations of understanding the user flow and goals of the two users, we started to recognise the key features and user journey of the application. From there, we were able to work on sketches and wireframes in order to refine the application flow.</p>

<p>Alongside these sketches, our client required a new branding palette which was consistently re-iterated. It was crucial that the product contained a serious but also exciting demeanour.</p>

        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Once the wireframes were confirmed alongside the branding palette, I started to design the high-fidelity designs of the application.</p>

<p>This included some inspiration research on what competitors are doing: where they went well and where they could improve. It was identified that YouTrumpetâ€™s competitors did well in regards to providing campaign data, but the visual aspects of how the data was represented could have been improved.</p>

<p>From there, I started to mock-up more modern visuals and combined important data visualisation for both Campaigners and Promoters.</p>

<p>The main flow of the application is for Campaigners to create campaigns and for Promoters to promote them, therefore it was crucial for the flow to be easily navigated.</p>

        <p class="h3">Build, test & re-iterate</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Given the amount of time put into researching, re-iterating user flows and wireframes alongside understanding the user personas. I was able to produce an MVP application that accommodated the user goals.</p>

<p>I identified that data was important for Campaigners, and that at the same time, data can be overwhelming when it is not visualised in a flowing manner. I separated important everyday stats and reporting stats on separate pages to avoid content overload for Campaigners. I also minimised the amount of data for Promoters as they do not require every single information of a campaign, but instead the campaigns they promoted.</p>
