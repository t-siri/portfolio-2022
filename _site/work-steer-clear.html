        <p class="h3">Introduction</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Steer Clear is an application that I have designed and scoped on my own. It’s a passion project of mine that I want to share with multiple people struggling with the transparency of ingredients being used in products.</p>

<p>I personally want to use this application myself to simplify my everyday life. I have some allergies to ingredients that I must avoid and alongside that I want to avoid a few others that are not sustainably sourced.</p>

<p>After undergoing an allergy test, I realised that each ingredient had multiple different names associated to it and I wasn’t able to memorise every single ingredient that I had to avoid.</p>

<p>From there - I thought it would be ideal to have an application that could simplify my everyday shopping experience by just scanning products and letting me know if I could purchase it or not.</p>

        <p class="h3">Understand & refine</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Given that this product was an idea that stemmed from the pain points of my everyday life, I identified the problem on my own and then validated with other individuals I knew that suffered with allergies as well. I also asked a few people that were conscious with their lifestyle on how they avoided their chosen ingredients.</p>

<p>It was clear that everyone was spending a significant amount of time reading every ingredient of each product they were purchasing. If they were uncertain about the ingredient, they would not purchase the product at all.</p>

<p>I could identify that there was not a standardised way to clearly let people know what types of ingredients are being used in products, and for those who care about these ingredients have a harder time. I wanted to cater to them, but also I wanted to make my life easier as well.</p>

<p>I started brainstorming a few things for this application, from a chrome extension to an application. Once I concluded to what I wanted from this idea, I was able to produce a few sketches.</p>

        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Given the freedom of this being my idea, I produced a palette and design system that I liked. The narrative and the colours of the application was designed to be more fun and bold. Given that it is already painful to be allergic to things and having to read through the ingredients list every time you pick up a new product - I wanted to ensure that the application use felt less like a chore or a forced feeling but more of a ‘curious about a product’ feeling.</p>

<p>It was crucial to keep the application very simple, we want users to jump onto the application, add their allergies and scan or search for products that they could be allergic to or are trying to avoid.</p>

<p>I also wanted the application to be an everyday use product, so that users didn’t always have to re-scan things when they’re out shopping. Users could customise to Steer Clear of multiple things, whether it’s ingredients they’re allergic to or just trying to avoid consciously. Each time the user scans a product that results into steering clear of it or being a conscious buyer, the product is saved against their profile.</p>

        <p class="h3">Build, test & re-iterate</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>With the flexibility of this product and the requirements are from what I wanted from it, I was able to create the final high-fidelity prototype to my own liking.</p>

<p>I validated my designs with a few friends that I know suffer from allergies and those that are trying to be more sustainable with their everyday purchases. I received positive feedback and some feedback in regards to additional features and changes in features.</p>

<p>I now have the refined high-fidelity prototype and am hoping to have this application being developed soon.</p>
