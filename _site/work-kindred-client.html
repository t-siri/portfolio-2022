        <p class="h3">Introduction</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>During my employment with <a href="https://workingmouse.com.au/" target="_blank">WorkingMouse,</a> I had the opportunity as a Product Designer to work with Kindred, a client in the real-estate space.</p>

<p>The client came to WorkingMouse with an underlying problem in the industry’s workflow, which resulted into a client portal.</p>

<p>Alongside this client portal, we created the <a href="/work-kindred-admin">Green Zone Portal</a>, which solved an internal business issue.</p>

        <p class="h3">Understand & refine</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Kindred came to us with a problem where he felt that the real-estate industry is not doing a satisfactory job in regards to promptly responding to customers. Our client came to us and wanted us to find a solution for not only their business but also the industry as a whole.</p>

<p>In order to understand and unpack the problem, I was able to run through discovery/user interviews with the users (Kindred’s clients) and the customer service team. After a few interviews with both audiences, we were able to refine the wicked problem.</p>

<p>Kindred’s users wanted to be able to continuously contact real-estate agents at times that are convenient with them. They wanted to be able to also have generic questions that are not related to properties answered, such as first home buying, property investments and the suburb they are interested in.</p>

<p>As for real-estate agents, they wanted to be able to communicate with their customers and solve their problem quickly but also understand their customer — a background on what their customer is looking for or goals are.</p>

<p>We presented the findings to our client and have recognised that the users wanted to be able to feel like Kindred was not just a company that provided properties but an experience to individuals that had uncertainty with the whole process. From there, Kindred discovered that it was ideal to have a platform that allowed their customers to interact with them and their customer service team seamlessly about anything related to purchasing a property — a relationship rather than a transaction.</p>

        <p class="h3">Ideate & refine</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Once understanding and refining Kindred’s problem, we then started to brainstorm on what this platform could do. This involved going through an ideal user journey according to persona types and throwing out ideas on how to make the journey pleasant. We had a white boarding session on possible outcomes that would solve the problem we refined previously. There were multiple solutions that branched out from the ideation stage, and it was crucial to refine those ideation.</p>

<p>After the ideation workshop, I worked with the client in regards to refining these ideas and understanding on which ones we wanted to focus on.</p>

<p>This resulted into the following:</p>

<p class="b ul-heading">Kindred's cutomers</p>
<ul>
  <li>Live messaging
    <ul>
      <li>Ability to message about topics that are not related to the property</li>
      <li>Ability to message about property user is interested in, so there is a thread</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Saving properties</li>
  <li>Viewing properties</li>
  <li>Users creating unique profile so customer service can identify their persona</li>
  <li>Users providing feedback in order for the customer service team can further improve</li>
</ul>

<p class="b ul-heading">Kindred's cutomer service team</p>
<ul>
  <li>To seamlessly communicate with their customers and understand more on what their customers are after</li>
  <li>Schedule best contact times and notify customers</li>
  <li>Viewing properties</li>
  <li>Provide the right information to their customers as quickly as possible</li>
  <li>Retrieve customer service feedback</li>
</ul>

        <p class="h3">Build, test & re-iterate</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>With the refined ideas, I spent some time researching competitors and what others were doing. As a lot of realestate companies did not really have products that were related to customer service, I also conducted market research in regards to online customer service. I researched for inspiration and put my findings together in order to start sketching a few outcomes of how the platform could resulted to. This process was continuous where I would sketch potential screens and journeys and conducted user testing for feedback. With the feedback I would re-sketch the outcomes, re-iterate them and conducted user testing again. Once the user testing feedback were positive, where the users wanted to use the platform and engage with it, I then did wireframe mockups.</p>

<p>I then user tested the wireframes and re-iterated on them. I then presented the wireframes to Kindred, presented the user journey and what the user will experience. After a few feedback, I was happy with where the wireframes and the journey resulted into.</p>

<p>I gathered the screens from my wireframes and started to produce a high-fidelity prototype. Using XD, I produced the mobile screens for Kindred’s users first and immediately user tested the mobile mock-up. I re-iterated on the prototype in regards to UI designs, on where the buttons could be sitting, size of buttons and placement of components. Once the final stage of user testing was completed, I proceeded to designing the web platform prototype and conducted user testing.</p>

<p>In order for the clients to communicate seamlessly with the customer service team, Kindred needed a customer service portal.</p>

<p>I conducted market research in online customer service alongside inspiration on similar platforms such as chatting and customer service platforms (identifying customers quickly in order to retain a strong relationship). I started sketching the customer service portal and immediately user tested them. Given that the feedback from the customer service team was immediately positive, I went straight to Hi-Fi prototyping. I user tested the Hi-Fi prototype and refined the prototype from the feedback given by the customer service team.</p>
