        <div class="work-desc">
<p>During my employment with <a href="/workingmouse" target="_blank">WorkingMouse</a> I had the opportunity to work with <a href="/codebotsmarketing">Codebots</a> and developed both <a href="/work-codebots-v1">version 1</a> and version 2 of the marketing website.</p>

<p>After deploying the MVP of version 1, the company had the opportunity to do some user testing and user research to further improve the marketing site in order to get more tractions.</p>

<p>My lead, Isaac Joekong, conducted a user testing on version 1 of the marketing website and made design updates accordingly.</p>

        <div class="work-desc">
<p>As the company deployed the MVP of version 1, the user testing was conducted and the design lead of Codebots obtained new learnings.</p>

<p>With these learnings, it was discovered that there were a lot of design updates that could be done in order to gain the users’ attention on the site.</p>

<p>These new design updates required re-coding as well as new coding in the front-end. It was crucial that these were components that would allow re-use for future purposes.</p>

<p>It was recognised that the website had a lot of content and had to be broken up into a few more sections. Additionally some <em>modern</em> designs could be introduced such as a carousel component and tabs to view information.</p>

<p>Components were re-iterated and written in a way to allow re-use. I also had the opportunity to update and clean a few sections in order to hand-over to the next developer.</p>

<p>With the new designs, I was able to work more on animations and learn new things along the way such as jekyll loops, svg animations and the carousel component.</p>

<p>The marketing website is now stable and has minor improvements to it.</p>

<p>Given the time constraint to code version 2, there were more interactive components on the site. Alongside that, animations were added for site polishing, which was crucial.</p>

<p>I made sure before the handover of the code that it was well documented and put into sections accordingly. Having been improved, the marketing website has been managed by Jordi Kitto.</p>
