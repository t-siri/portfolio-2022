					Understand

					<li>Client wanted to cater to users with little to no experience of the industry</li>
					<li>But also at the same time wanted to cater traders that trade everyday</li>
					<li>Discovery interviews were done for these two user types</li>
					<li>Patterns and common pain points were found - users were often overwhelemed and not educated much
						about the industry, they wanted to feel safe with the idea</li>
					<li>Understood what competitors were doing well and weren't doing well according to these users -
						most platforms were extremely overwhelming with no guidance</li>
					<li>From all the discovery interviews, we were able to identify the most simple and ideal user
						journey for target market 1 (users with little to no knowledge)</li>
					<li>We were also able to identify pre-requisites of the application and where major complexity lies
						for an MVP, which allowed the development team to start their investigations on things that were
						uncertain whilst I was scoping</li>
