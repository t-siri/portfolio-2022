        <div class="work-desc">
<p>STAKT is a cyrpto trading application based in Australia with a goal to cater towards users with little to no knowledge in the industry but wants to invest in cryptocurrency. During my employment with PatientZero, I had the opportunity to work on this project as a Product Owner and a Product Designer. Given it was a GreenField project, there were multiple workshops that were required to accomplish the desired outcome of the product.</p>

<p>In addition to designing the product, I had to balance between the importance of design and producing a minimum viable product. As this project immediately moved from design straight to development where I was the Product Owner, it was very important to ensure that consistency of designs occur at the start of the project.</p>

        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Our client had a clear goal on what they want to build and with every vision, it was important to narrow it down.</p>

<p>Key users and personas were first identified in prior to proceeding with workshopping user journey flow. After identifying with the client what the product goal was and who their key users were, it was found that there were two main users that sit at both sides of the spectrum – one of which who had no confidence in cryptocurrency and the other knowing exactly what they were doing in the industry by consistently trading/investing.</p>

<p>I conducted a few discovery interviews of users that fit the following personas to identify the gap in the market and where STAKT could stand out uniquely. We were able to find key patterns and pain points from these interviews which allowed us to produce a simplified user journey flow. Discovery interviews were very important at this stage as it allowed us to identify the gap in the industry that we wouldn’t be able to find ourselves – such as what STAKT’s competitors did well and didn’t do well, and why users were not ready to invest.</p>

<p>User journey flows for the two identified user types were workshopped with the clients, this included with a starting point and an end goal for each user, from there we identified pre-requisites and parallel journeys to reach to each point. We also ensured that the flow reflected our findings from the discovery interviews. Once the desired user journey flows were identified, I was able to come up with a few sketches.</p>

<p>Each page were sketched according to the flows and requested/ideal features from the discovery interviews, I then designed key screens for the product where users could potentially come across. At the same time I had to ensure that we were staying on task with an MVP and designed key requirements and features.</p>

        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Given time was very limited, sketches were immediately converted to wireframes. I also took the time to see what other competitors were doing and gathered ideal features from the discovery interviews that were conducted previously.</p>

<p>Simplicity and education was the most important requirements that STAKT wanted from their product, each screen had a goal that ideally navigated users unconciously to the next screen following the user flow.</p>

<p>Conducting user testing with these wireframes, I wanted to ensure that each user followed through with the user journey flow. Designs of the grey-scale wireframes were consistently re-iterated until we were ready to move onto the high-fidelity designs.</p>

    <div class="description">
        <p class="h3">Build, test & re-iterate</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Given that the product was going to move straight from hi-fi designs to development, prior to producing each screen – I had to ensure that I identified the theme of the product alongside components.</p>

<p>The clients provided their branding guidelines which allowed me to produce the key product theme and components. Each component had a passive, hover, active, focus and disabled state. With this, it enforced me to then produce screens and use these components, allowing consistency with each screen and avoiding a change of mind in designs (which would have caused multiple refinement tickets in the future for development).</p>

<p>Once these components were identified, I produced high fidelity screens from each wireframe. User testing were conducted on the main screens and given that the wireframes were mainly re-iterated, there were only minor tweaks required for the hi-fi designs.</p>

<p>At the same time, I was working in parallel as a Product Owner and broke these screens down into user stories and tickets for development. I also had to order the backlog according to dependencies and pre-requisites of each feature.</p>
