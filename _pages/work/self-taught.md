{% contentfor introduction %}
Self taught is an online application that aids students learn languages and log their progress in regards to their studies, homework and verbal practice.

If assigned, teachers can view their students’ progress and review/assign their homework. Additionally, students have the capability of reviewing their own assignments by adding self assigned homework, new words to their dictionary and audiobook for further practice.

During my time working with my client in regards to this project, I was focusing on introducing a modern user interface design and mobile user experience design.

{% contentfor problem %}
Given that Self Taught was already built and deployed, my client came to me to re-iterate the application and look into a modern user interface design as he wanted to reach more users.

Further understanding his problem, I did a few investigations on his project and noted down improvements that could be introduced.

I conducted user research with students who study languages and wanted to further advance their skills in their own accord. Additionally, I did market research and discovered what competitors where doing.

I presented my findings to my client and refined the problem to the following:

- More modern user interface
- Simpler navigation system
- Quickly jump to a time gap and view changes
- Mobile responsive application
- Mobile user experience

From the refinement of the problem that my client had, it was crucial to identify the user’s journey in order to produce the right navigating system. The client and I workshopped on a few user journeys and were able to identify the main user journey for the students using the application. From there, I spent some time researching for inspiration and patterns in regards to platforms that were doing similar functionalities. I presented my findings to my client and we started to brainstorm a few ideas on what the mobile application could additionally have the web application did not. My client and I discussed on potential features that could be included in the new designs. From there, I spent some time sketching a few ideas of the mobile application as well as a few tweaks I the web application, showed my client and re-iterated on the sketches. Once he had a clear understanding of the sketches, I started inspiration research in regards to user interface designs and noted down on design changes that could be made. From there, I immediately moved onto the Hi-Fi prototype.

{% contentfor outcome %}
I identified that the prototype required a more modernised but simple approach to the user interface design. Given that there are two main navigating systems and nested information, the simplicity of the UI is crucial. I started the mobile designs first and re-iterated with my client with the navigating system and the nested pages. From there I conducted user testing and made updates in regards to component placements and sizes. Once user testing resulted into a manner where our users were able to complete assigned tasks on the prototype without hesitation, I immediately moved onto the web application prototype. Given the web application provides more real estate in regards to UI placement, it was less complex as the mobile prototype. I user tested the web application and re-iterated a few components and presented to my client.
