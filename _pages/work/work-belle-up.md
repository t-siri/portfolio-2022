{% contentfor introduction %}
Belle Up is a beauty application project that I had the opportunity to scope and design with my clients. The goal of this product is to provide a platform for beauticians to create their services where-ever and whenever they choose to do so.

We wanted to star the beauticians in this application, as it was clear that without them, the application was non-existent.

The second goal was to ensure that the application was easily used between the two types of users (Customers and Beauticians) and that we could cater multiple types of users looking for beauty services on the platform without overwhelming them with too many features.

{% contentfor problem %}
The importance of this product was to identify the core problem in the market and also find patterns of what users in the industry have to say.

I took the time to interview 4 potential customers and 4 potential beauticians prior to establishing a user flow. During these interviews it was clear that there wasn't a platform that provided a simple booking system for sole trading beauticians.

Customers had to find their preferred beauticians within their area using social media, whilst Beauticians had to post their services on social media and kept track of their calendar and bookings on a seperate platform.

After identifying the key pain points and patterns from these interviews, I was able to conclude what the ideal application would be for these user types. The main flow and features for the customers concluded to the ability to search for services nearby, book these services or message the Beautician privately for a custom services. Whereas for the beauticians, they want to easily post different types services, manage conflicting bookings and custom services.

From there I created sketches for the customer's flow and the beautician's flow.

It was crucial to identify the key user journey during the sketching sessions as we wanted to ensure that part was done correctly before looking at branding and high fidelity screens. There were a few platforms (competitors) in the industry but from the discovery interview - they were too complex.

I made the assumption (from my gathered research) that customers are most likely to make bookings from word of mouth or reviews, and that we had to star the beauticians on the application. In addition, once a customer has found a beautician that have outstanding ratings, they wouldn't mind paying extra for a custom service or a service that could fit their time slot. It was more about convenience and quality of service rather than availability and price. So I ensured that the sketches allowed custom booking requests.

In regards to the beauticians, their concern was mainly safety and the ability to choose who they want to provide their services to. Given that they are operating their services mostly at home, they wanted a sense of security in who they meet up and also a sense of security in getting paid. I was able to conclude that for them, they didn't want to deal with users that cancel last minute or avoid paying. The result to that was to ensure that the application processed payments prior to making a booking and that beauticians had the power to accept or reject a booking before it is confirmed. Additionally, we also allowed beauticians to create custom bookings for customers to allow them to accommodate to their clients - as each client and each service is different.

Once the sketches and screens were refined, I was able to convert them into low fidelity wireframes (greyscale) and conducted user testing on these wireframes.

From the user testing on the wireframes, it was concluded that our user flow was heading towards the right direction but there were some sections that could have been improved and some requested features for both customers and beauticians. I refined the wireframes according to the feedback received and conducted user testing again until the outcome and feedback was positive.

{% contentfor outcome %}
Since most of the time was spent on wireframes and re-iterating the user flow, producing the high-fidelity screens was no issue.

I was able to spend some time to look for inspiration in regards to branding and colours - and from there I started to conduct a palette for the application.

Using the wireframe screens, I converted them into high-fidelity screens with the palette that I have designed and it started to come all together.

Finally, I conducted user testing on the high fidelity prototype on 4 potential customers and 4 potential beauticians. The result of the user testing only required minor adjustments. Once I re-iterated and refined those designs, I did a final run of user testing and was able to complete the scope and product design.
