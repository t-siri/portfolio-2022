{% contentfor introduction %}
Carted is a side project I have founded and is a current work in progress in regards to development.

One day, I walked into IKEA and wanted a chair but did not want to pay the full price, and thought to myself: _If only I could scan the barcode of the item and get a notification when the product has reduced in price._

I felt that there was a gap in shopping and how it could be further simplified in regards to finding the right products at a great price.

{% contentfor problem %}
The problem for me which I discovered was a common problem with other users as well was that it was very tedious to find items for the best price and the amount spent on finding the right product at a discounted price could be shorten by more than half. In addition, upon finding the right product at a discounted price would not always favour in what you are willing to pay for, so you end up leaving the tab opened and constantly refreshing the page to see if prices have changed.

From here I refined the general issue into a problem statement: _How can we have a better window shopping experience and purchase an item at the lowest price, or the price we are willing to pay with minimal research time spent_

{% contentfor solution %}
With the problem statement I started ideating multiple solutions of what this platform could be. I did some research to see what competitors were doing and realised that the competitors were a decade behind in design and usability. I tested out the competitorsâ€™ applications and realised that it was a very average user experience in general.

I started sketching screens and writing down a few feature ideas of Carted and started conducting user testing with online shoppers. I discovered their pain points were very similar to mine and that I could simplify online shopping with Carted.

It was important that Carted saved users time in regards to researching for the product online, but also while they are physically online shopping. Users also wanted to be notified when an item they are watching has dropped in price.

{% contentfor outcome %}
With the sketches I produced from the ideation stage, I discovered that during the user testing that these sketches were valid and users had positive feedback in regards to the journey of the application and the simplicity of its features.

From there I started inspiration research in regards to branding and component layouts. I wanted the colours to be less of a _spending_ money experience but a _list_ of things you want to be notified about. It was also very important to immediately search for products or find products, hence the search being on the home page. Barcode scanning functionality is also important for users that like to physically window shop.

I immediately went to the Hi-Fi prototype and ran through user testing. I re-iterated the prototype with a few tweaks in regards to component placement but also additional features.
