{% contentfor introduction %}
During my employment with <a href="/workingmouse" target="_blank">WorkingMouse</a> I had the opportunity to work with <a href="/codebotsmarketing">Codebots</a> and developed Codebots marketing website.

I had the opportunity to learn a new programming language Jekyll and applied my skill sets in front-end development to build the website.
{% endcontentfor %}

{% contentfor problem %}
Codebots required a faster marketing website with more modern aesthetics and interaction.

Being a sister company of WorkingMouse. I had the opportunity to develop the front-end of this website using Jekyll - HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and Jekyll liquids. It was also crucial for this site to be responsive and accessible.

<a href="/codebotsmarketing">View the website here.</a>
{% endcontentfor %}

{% contentfor solution %}
The company decided on using Jekyll as the programming language which used HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and Jekyll loops to create the front-end of the website.

The HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript was written in a specific manner to allow accessible navigation, theme responsive colours, responsiveness and modern aesthetics.
{% endcontentfor %}

{% contentfor outcome %}
The website had been <a href="/codebotsmarketing">live</a> and the front-end was written and set-up by me.

Given that the handover was required, I made sure to write the project in a standardised manner, where the simplicity of changing and updating the website was as easy as changing class names

To preview how I was able to accomplish this and how easy it was, please <a href="#" onclick="toggleContact()">contact</a> me for a demo.
